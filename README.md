# George Washington University Data Science Undergraduate Capstone 

This GitHub Repo follows the set up of the GW Data Science Program and contains data, code, visualizations, presentations, and the final paper for the Capstone Project: Tracking Women's Political Empowerment (1900-2000).

The culmination for the work for this project can be found in the `app.r` file which creates a Shiny App using R Studio.

Data and background for this project comes from Sundstrom et al. and the V-Dem Institute.

This project was created by Athena Rodrigues.
